PID Symbols based on the ANSI/ISA
=======================================
The files published herewith are intended to provide a basis for developing a set of P&ID symbols based on the American National Standard (ANSI/ISA-5.1-2009).  This set includes only the current symbols used by Black & Veatch Limited in the UK for water industry related project work.  The attached files will allow a user to import the symbol artwork and create symbol components within the MicroStation environment.  Below is an explanation for each file type being published herewith:

<ol>
  <li>MicroStation .dgn file – this file is a legend sheet containing each symbol from the cell libraries (.cel files) also being published.  This legend sheet can be opened and viewed in MicroStation.</li>
  <li>Legend sheet as .pdf file – this file is a pdf version of (1) above.</li>
  <li>MicroStation .cel files – These files contain the working drawing/artwork for each symbol and must be used in conjunction with MicroStation.  The .cel files must be “attached” to a drawing within MicroStation to allow the individual symbols to be placed on a drawing and/or manipulated (including creating intelligent components within Bentley OpenPlantPID).</li>
